@*
    This class is a hack so that we can have row and column definitions processed before we evaluate
    the StyleCss property om Grid. By putting that evaluation on a child component, we get the Blazor
    rendering logic to evaluate the rows and columns first (because they are ordered first inside 
    Grid.razor). That causes StyleCss to have the correct value when we hit this component, so the
    div is styled correctly, and the children are just transparently passed through from Grid.

<div style="@Parent.StyleCss">
    @ChildContent
</div>

@code {
    [CascadingParameter]
    public Grid Parent
    {
        get;
        set;
    } = default!;

    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment? ChildContent
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}
